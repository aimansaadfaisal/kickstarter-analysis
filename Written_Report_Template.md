# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    In this challenge we are helping Louise analyse several thousand crowfunding projectsand using Excel tools to uncover hidden trends and adding data visualiozations to make the data easily readible and understandable.

### Purpose
In this challenge we wil help Louise to figure out how different campaigns fareed in relation to their launch date and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges
Having such a big data set was a big challlenge and trying to figure out why were we getting the value 0 for number canceled was a challange that was faced.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After filtering out data we can see that theater did really good between April and march but went downhill by the end of the year.A lot of them failed in october. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the visual representation we can tell that around 60% of the goals were met falling between the range of 35000 to 45000 but arounf 80% failed falling between the range of 25000 to 35000.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A lot of Challenges were faced trying to create the countifs function for getting the outcomes based on goals.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater should be done during the month og April and May and should be avoided during November and December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A lot of goals falling between the ranges pf 40,000 to 50000 and up were not met.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A lot of shows were canceled which was an outlier for this data set.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There are many that can be done for example outcomes based on pledged versus the goal, another one can be television outcomes based on launch date.
